# NOTICE : google-apputils has been added as a snakebite dependency. It may look
# useless in the first place since supervisor is installed using pip/setup.py
# which are supposed to install dependencies as well but there is a certificate
# issue on OSX when using setup.py. Therefore we have to make sure our
# dependency is installed before supervisor gets setup.

name "google-apputils"
default_version "0.4.2"

# Required by snakebite
